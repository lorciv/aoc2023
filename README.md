# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to the puzzles.

## Day 1

Initially, part 2 worked on tests but failed on input. I couldn't understand why.
Then on r/adventofcode I read that the program needs to take into account overlapping words.
It was a simple change in the code, but left me disheartened.

## Day 2

I found input parsing to be a bit too elaborated for being just the second day of the challenge.
Postponed part 2 for now. Omitted tests as well.

## Day 3

Super tedious!
Part 2 skipped for now.

## Day 4

Finally an easier task.
Part 2 skipped for now.
